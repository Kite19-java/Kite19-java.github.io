        Hiiiii! Babiii ay baka magalit ka na Babiii tawag ko sayo stranger lang naman ako sayo Charezzz. Kate, 
            Happy Birthdayyy to the one who makes my heart skip a beat! 🎉💖 On your special day, I just want to take a moment to tell you how amazing you truly are.
            Your kindness, your smile, and the way you light up my world and my heart💖 I will spend my whole life trying to give you the love that you should deserve. 
            You deserve all the happiness in the world and so much more because someone as special as you should always feel loved and appreciated.
            I hope your day is filled with laughter, unforgettable moments, and all the things that make you happiest. Sending you my warmest wishes,

<h2> Hi! Po. </h2>
        <p>
           I may not be good with words, topics or comforting but, whenever you need someone to tell something’s,
         I’m always here I will try my best to comfort you at your lowest. And please don’t forget,
          even I’m not physically there, by your side, I will still be by your side, 
          supporting and loving you unconditionally. I’m still learning on how to make you smile😊 and how to gain your trust. 
          🙁and sorry if I love you too much, or get a bit annoying chatting you like literally everyday but believe me when I say imissyou, 143,
           nagsisi ako nun na diko sinabi agad na gusto kita😕. Superrr nahihiya ako kasi baka hindi ako pasok sa standard mo.
            At kung saan na ako ngayon may lakas ng loob na sabihin sayo how I truly feel. But now that chance is gone because your far away,
        </p>
          
      <br>
        <p>
          And now like pag pupunta na ako sa school or sa sambahan I am hoping na Makita kita ulit kahit saglit lang para masabi ko nang maayos 😢.
           pero parang wala na eh nakaalis kana at sabi mo pa dikana babalik sa aklan. But I am still hoping na uuwi karin someday😊 
        </p>

<br>

        <p>
          And I reallyyy wanttt to hug youuu but you’reee sooo Malayooo hahaha maybe in the future if payagan moko i hug ka😆 but for now I’ll admire and pray for your safety from afar 
          😫HALAA!! AHHAHAAHAHHA naiiyak ako, habang nag susulat neto😆
          but yeahh your replies sometimes are cold or late🙄 pero that’s okay lang po alam ko po naman na you have busy sched.
            and you also mention na you missed someone and 
          I know that’s not me. And I know that you have a crush on someone else, 
          pero I remember na sinabi mo na you have a crush on me kahit kunti at saglit lang, 
         never forget how happy I was. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          But I wanted to remind you, that I’m not going anywhere, I,m not going to leave, 
        my feelings aren’t going to change, and always ako sa side mo no matter what kahit malayo ako,
         because I’m sureee about sayo, moreee sureee than I’ve ever been about anythinggg in my life, and Kate please, 
         never be afraid to talk about your problems, you won’t annoy me, palagi ako an dito para makinig sayo. 
         Ako nga minsan yung na tatakot mag chat sayo eh😆 baka pag chat ko sabihin mo bigla na tama na ken wag muna ako kausapin,
          and I don’t want that to happen. 
        </p>

<br>

<p>
  Because losing you is a price that I can’t afford to pay. 
  I know we don’t have any label or whatsoever just friends as you told me and im happy for that and sinabi mo rin na that 
  you are not ready to enter a relationship and I understand that and I respect it,
   but I just wanna let you know that my feelings for you are real, 
   and I’m willing to wait until you are ready. For now I need to take a step back and take it 
   slow until the moment and the time is right. but for now, 
   I just want to get to know you even more and be a bff premium ultra pro max muna.😆
   
</p>

<br>

<p>
  I know yung efforts ko is not enough for you.
   I’m just a guy that who has nothing special at sobrangg simpleee ko lang,
    all that I have is loyalty and a kind heart☺️. And rest assure po that I don’t talk to other girls.
     I spend my time playing Minecraft, Genshin, ml, or scrolling sa tiktok or watching anime,
      until you chat again. That how it works eh, I don’t seek attention from other girls only you only you lang talaga😊.
      Sooo omkieee na poo tapos na na labas ko na lahat well not all talaga I’ll save nalang eto if we ever meet in the future f2f. 
      Again Kate Nicole Redison Happy Birthdayyy ❤🎀 
      gusto ko sana bigyan kita gift eh pero malayo ka next time nalang po😊 
</p>

<br>

<p>Please always take care of yourself po ☺️ and if you don’t ako magaalaga sayo sigee ka 😆 🙄</p>
